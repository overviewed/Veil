# Veil
Shitty Webhook Spammer created by me inspired by facade & avale


install the libraries in `requirements.txt` and run the veil.py file
if aiohttp doesnt install try using the 
`aiohttp 3.7.4.post0` version 
if this doesnt work idk what to tell you

credits to avale and facade for giving me the idea to do this
